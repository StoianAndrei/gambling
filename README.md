We have developed the GMP Dashboard to make it easier for users to visualise data trends. Open the spreadsheet below to learn more about the number of gaming machines and licenced premises by territorial authority, and how these numbers have changed over time.

## Report 1 - EGM and GMP at suburb level for quarter to (date)

This document lists all venues in the clusters to which they have been assigned. Information on the venues themselves, such as addresses and class of venue (i.e. club/hotel etc) is already published on this web page. Venues have been clustered by area within a larger region (e.g. Newton, Auckland). Where there are fewer than three venues in an area, areas have been combined into clusters of three or more venues, with consideration given to both geographic and socio-economic location.

## Report 2 - List of venues per cluster as of (date)

This list tabulates key information about clusters of venues. When published, it will include a caveat that adjustments can be made for incidents such as unpaid jackpots or unpaid winnings. These adjustments are made after the incident, and may be for a different period. GMP may be affected depending on when adjustments are made, and therefore this data cannot be compared to the published quarterly statistics.

## Report 3 - GMP by number of machines at venue for quarter to (date)

This tabulates GMP data according to the number of machines at a venue. No data is provided for venues with one machine or more than 18 machines, as there are only two venues fitting in to each category.

## Report 4 - GMP by class of venue for quarter to (date)

This tabulates GMP according to the class of venue.
